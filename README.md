# Python client for accessing FCA/Stellantis cars cloud API

## Installation

`pip3 install py-uconnect`

## Usage

```python
from py_uconnect import brands, Client

# Create client
client = Client('foo@bar.com', 'very_secret', pin='1234', brand=brands.FIAT_EU)
# Fetch the vehicle data into cache
client.refresh()

# List vehicles
vehicles = client.get_vehicles()
for vehicle in vehicles.values():
    print(vehicle.to_json(indent=2))
```

This would emit something similar to:
```json

## Additional API methods

```python
# Vehicle health report
report = client.get_vehicle_health_report(vin)

# Maintenance history
history = client.get_maintenance_history(vin)

# Eco-coaching trip data
last_trip = client.get_eco_coaching_last_trip(vin)
trips = client.get_eco_coaching_trips(vin)

# Vehicle image (dedicated endpoint)
image = client.get_vehicle_image(vin)

# EV charge schedules
schedules = client.get_charge_schedules(vin)
client.set_charge_schedule(vin, schedule)

# Remote operation status (check if a command succeeded)
status = client.get_remote_operation_status(vin, correlation_id)

# Stolen vehicle locator status (SiriusXM Guardian / SVLA)
svla = client.get_stolen_vehicle_status(vin)

# Vehicle subscription status
subscription = client.get_vehicle_subscription(vin)

# Set vehicle nickname
client.set_vehicle_nickname(vin, "My Car")

# Trigger a fresh location update (returns correlation ID)
correlation_id = client.update_location(vin)

# Trigger a PIN-authenticated deep refresh so the car pushes fresh
# battery/charge/odometer data to the cloud, then re-read it. This is the
# same flow the official apps use when a refresh asks for the PIN.
client.refresh_vehicle_data(vin)
client.refresh()  # re-read the updated status from the cloud
```

## PIN handling

Remote actions (commands, location refresh, deep refresh, charge schedule,
charging level) require a PIN. The library authenticates the PIN once, caches
the resulting token, and reuses it for subsequent actions.

The Stellantis backend periodically invalidates the PIN token and rejects
the affected request with `403`/`404` — the official apps re-prompt for the
PIN and retry in this case. The library now does the same: on a `403`/`404`
from a PIN-authenticated action it re-authenticates the PIN and retries once,
and if that is also rejected it forces a fresh login and retries again.

To get fresh EV/battery data on demand for vehicles that don't push it
frequently, use `refresh_vehicle_data(vin)` (the PIN-gated deep refresh),
then `refresh()` to re-read the updated status.

## Service Delivery Platform (SDP)

NAFTA vehicles report a `sdp` field indicating the connected services provider:
- `"SXM"` - SiriusXM Guardian
- `"SPRINT"` - Uconnect Access (Sprint/T-Mobile)
- `null` - EMEA/LATAM/IAP regions (no SDP distinction)

The `enabled_services` field lists all active services on the vehicle, including
non-command services like `SVLA` (Stolen Vehicle Locator), `BCALL`, `ECALL`, etc.

## SiriusXM Guardian vehicles

Some US-market vehicles use SiriusXM Guardian as their connected services provider
instead of the standard Uconnect cellular service. These vehicles may not appear in
the API if the account has not been properly linked.

Analysis of the official Stellantis mobile apps (Ram NAFTA, Chrysler NAFTA, Wagoneer
NAFTA) shows that:

- There are **no separate API endpoints** for SXM Guardian vehicles. All vehicles use
  `channels.sdpr-02.fcagcv.com` regardless of SDP type.
- The `sdp` field only affects UI presentation (subscription messages, branding).
- The apps contain a **legacy Mopar login fallback**: when Gigya login fails for a
  Mopar-only account, the app POSTs to `api.extra.fcagroup.com` which triggers a
  server-side account migration to Gigya, then retries the standard login.

This suggests SXM Guardian vehicles should work once the account is migrated to Gigya.
However, we cannot fully verify this without a real SXM Guardian account because some
configuration values in the APK are encrypted.

If your SiriusXM Guardian vehicle does not appear:

1. Install the official app for your brand (Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, Dodge, etc.)
2. Log in with your Mopar/SXM Guardian credentials
3. If the app prompts you to link or migrate your account, complete the process
4. Verify your vehicle is visible and functional in the official app
5. Use the same credentials with this library

If your vehicle still does not appear after completing these steps, please open an
issue with your vehicle year, make, model, and whether it shows in the official app.
